## 24 - Product Vision and Product Strategy

### The Product vision
The future that we are trying to create - two to five years from now.

Primary purpose is to communicate this vision and inspire teams (stakeholders, partners, customers) to want to help make this vision a reality.

Visions can be tested - but are ultimately always a bit of a leap of faith.

### Product Strategy

Trying to please everybody will almost certainly please nobody.

Product strategy is our sequence or releases to deliver on the path to realize the product vision.

Teams are encouraged to construct strategy around a series of product market fits. 

Might have a different strategy for each different vertical market (financial, healthcare).

Consumer focused companies are often structured around a different persona / user.

Product strategy may be based on achieving a set of key milestones in a specific logical order.

Our goal is to come up with the smallest actual deliverable product that makes these customers successful.

Vision and strategy are analogous to leadership and management. Leadership sets the direction, but management actually gets us there.

### Prioritizing Markets

Factors that can influence how we prioritize markets:

* Total addressable market (TAM). 
    * Markets where the product can have more impact are preferable to those where it will have smaller impact.
* Go to market (GTM).
    * Different markets have different sales channels and go to market strategies.
* Time to market (TTM). 
    * How long will it take to deliver to that market?

## 25 - Principles of Product Vision

* Start with why. 
    * Use the product vision to articulate your purpose. 
    * Everything follows from that.
* Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.
* Don’t be afraid to think big with the vision. 
    * Product visions need to be >1 year to deliver on.
* Don’t be afraid to disrupt yourselves.
* The product vision needs to inspire. 
    * We need teams of missionaries, not mercenaries. 
    * Vision inspires passion.
    * Any vision can be meaningful if you focus on how it helps your users and customers.
* Determine and embrace relevant and meaningful trends.
    * Companies ignore trends for far too long. 
    * Not hard to identify important trends. 
    * Hard to help the organization understand how those trends can be leveraged to solve customer problems.
* Skate to where the puck is heading - not where it was. 
    * Identify what will, and will not be changing in the time frame of the product vision.
* Be stubborn on vision but flexible on details. 
    * Vision pivot is the sign of a weak product organization.
* Any product vision is a leap of faith.
* Evangelize continuously and relentlessly. 
    * No such thing as over-communicating when it comes to explaining and selling the vision. Especially in larger organizations.

## 26 - Principles of Product Strategy
* Focus on one target market or persona at a time. 
    * Don’t try and please everyone in a single release.
* Product strategy needs to be aligned with business strategy.
    * Vision is meant to inspire the organization.
    * Organization comes up with solutions that deliver on the strategy. 
* Product strategy needs to be aligned with sales and GTM strategy.
* Obsess over customers, not over competitors. 
    * Panic and chase their competitors' actions and lose focus on the customer.
* Communicate the strategy across the organization. 
    * Evangelize the vision.
    * Everyone needs to know the customers that we will focus on now, and which are planned for later.

## 27 - Product Principles

The nature of the products that we want to create.

Not a list of features & not tied to any one product release.

Most important is aligning with what the company and product teams believe is important.

Principles are a clear statement of what you believe.
