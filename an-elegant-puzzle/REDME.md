## 3.3 Visions and Strategies

### 3.3 Strategies and Visions

#### What is a strategy?
Grounded documents that explain the trade-offs and actions to be taken to address a specific challenge.

#### What is a vision?
Aspirational documents that enable individuals who don’t work closely to make decisions that fit well together.

### 3.4 Strategy

Strategies are composed of:
* Diagnosis. 
    * Effectively a problem statement. 
    * Well defined problem statements will generate several good candidate approaches.
* Policies. 
    * Describes a general approach you will take and are often trade-offs between two competing goals.
    * Good guiding policies will take a stance on competing goals.
* Actions. 
    * Applying your guiding policies to the diagnosis will lead to actions. 
    * Good actions may be uncomfortable, but you can see that it will work.

Strategies are specific to a given problem, so it is ok to write a few. 
The act of writing a strategy leads folks through a systematic analysis. 
They help us work through challenges both overwhelming and mundane.

### 3.5 Vision

Visions are composed of:

* Vision statement. 
    * 1 or 2 sentence aspirational statement. 
    * Core speaking point that will get repeated everywhere. 
    * Needs to memorably evoke the vision.
* Value proposition. 
    * How will we be valuable to our users? 
    * What kinds of success will you enable them to achieve?
* Capabilities. 
    * What capabilities will the product, platform or team need to deliver on the value proposition? 
* Solved constraints. 
    * What are the constraints that you’re limited by today but will not be in future?
* Future constraints. 
    * What are the constraints you expect to encounter in the future?
* Narrative.
    * Synthesize this all into a one-page narrative that is easy to digest.

Vision is succeeding when people reference the document to make their own decisions. 
Vision is struggling when decisions happen that don’t fit into its direction.

Additional tips:
* Test the document. 
    * First version will be bad. Iterate with folks until we can synthesize feedback.
* Refresh periodically. 
    * Take some time to refresh the vision.
* Write simply. 
    * Readers get turned off by buzzwords.
