## Procrastination

How does procrastination happen?

1. You think about something you really don't want to do, it activates areas assocaited with pain.
2. Brain funnels attention onto a more pleasant task.
3. You feel happier (temporarily).

Researchers has show that not long after people start working on the thing they didn't like the neurodiscomfort disappeared.

## Practice Makes Permanent

Ideas in math & science are mostly abstract ideas - you can't point at the thing. Other abstract ideas are tied to our emotion: love, hope.

The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring these ideas into reality for you. 

What happens when you solve a new problem?
* When you first begin to solve a problem, you create a weak neural pattern.
* When you solve a problem, from the start, without looking at the soltution, you have created a strong neural pattern.
* When you solve a problem, and can go over every step, without any prompts, after solving some adjacent problems, you have created the strongest neural pattern.

Disengaging from the focused mode allows your diffused mode which helps build the neural patterns needed to be successful.

Pomodoro technique can help with procrastination.

## Memory

### Working Memory

Working memory has to with what you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind.

Working memory can hold ~4 chunks of information.

Working memory is kind of like a blackboard where you need to keep repeating the thing to keep it in memory.

### Long Term Memory

When you first put an item of information into long term memory you need to practice and repeat it a few times.

Kind of like an immense memory warehouse.

Where you store fundamental concepts & techniques.

### Spaced Repetition

You use your working memory to learn something new, but want to store it in long-term memory.

Moving something from working memory to long term memory take time and practice.

Space repetition over a number of days makes a big difference.

Repeating information 20x in one evening is less effective that spreading these repetitions across multiple days.

It takes time to build new neural pathways.

## Sleep

Being awake creates toxic byproducts in your brain.
During sleep, your brain cells shrink and fluid passes past these cells and washes them out.

During sleep, your brain 'rehearses' some of the tougher parts of what you are trying to learn.

It is as if the deactivation of the concious 'you' allow other parts of the brain to talk more easily to oneanother.

Focused mode plants the seed for the diffuse mode to build the neural pathways. Like stepping through some specific steps.

## Interview with Dr Terrence Sejnowski

Active engagment with a topic, by asking questions, is a much better way of learning than passive engagement. 

Jogging or exercise is a great way of disengaging with the normal trains of thought. Unconcious thoughts bubble to the surface.

Better work is done in the evenings in a more self-reflective mode.

New neurons are born in the hippocampus throughout your life.

Mice that have better qualities of life have much better developed neural pathways than those that are kept in isolation.

Having a rich environment is really important as an adult, being around other people, events that you can actively engage with. Excercise also increases the amount of neurons that are created in the hippocampus.

Being in creative environment enhances our own creativity. Better ideas when talking to others and trying to explain things to others. Having other people around to bouce ideas off.

Tests are like any other skill - you can practice and become good at it.

Success is not achieved by being smart - passion and persistence are the bigger determinants of success - staying the course, and not giving up.


# Week 2

## What is a chunk?

Mental leap that unites bits of information together though meaning. Creates a 'chunk'.

Memorising a fact without understanding or context, does not help it to make sense with other things your are learning.

Working memory is in the pre-frontal cortex.

'Octopus of attention' slips tenatcles through 4 slots of working memory to connect information

Diffuse mode makes random connections.

Memory does not appear to work right when you are angry, stressed or afraid.

Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning or use to one conceptual easy to understand chunk.

'Memory traces'

Creating expertise is to to create conceptual chunks, mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning. 

Chunk is a network of neurons that are used to firing together.

The path to expertise is built little by little, small chunks become larger.

Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk and idea, concept or action, you don't need to remember all the underlying details.

## How to form a chunk?

The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained that you don't even have to conciously think about connecting the neual pattern together.

When you are learning math & science you start out with worked through examples, it like hearing a song, before trying to play the song.

Chunking is different between mental and physical learning.

### Focus

Focus your undivided attention on the material at hand.
If your brain is elsewhere then your octopus can't use all the tentacles to join concepts.

### Understand

Like a superglue that combines underlying memory traces together.

You can create a chunk without understanding, but it will not fit into other chunks.

Understading alone is not necessary to achieve expertise, teacher can explain something in class then you forget.

Understanding requires repetition & practice, occurs when you can do it yourself.

Only doing it yourself creates the neural patterns required for mastery.

### Context

This allows you to know when, and when not, to use this chunk of information.

You have a tool in your tool box, but you don't know when to use it.

Practice helps you broaden the networks of neurons that are connected to your chunk., ensuring it is accessible from other paths.

Learning takes place in two ways: bottom up practice & repetition can help you buil;d and strengthen chunks.

Big picture process that allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in. 

Both bottom up & top-down processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material.

Doing a 2 minute walk through a text book can help you get a sense for the big picture.

They let you know where to put the chunks and how they fit together. One you have this - fill in the picture.
