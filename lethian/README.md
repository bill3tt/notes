## [Write five, then synthesize: good engineering strategy is boring.](https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/)

For a useful vision, few things to focus on are:
* Write 2-3 years out. 
    * Visions that expire in 6 months will quickly become obsolete.
* Ground in your business and users. 
    * Effective visions ground themselves in serving users & business. 
    * Tight connection with the leadership team’s core values, users and business. 
    * Bad visions treat technical sophistication as self-justifying.
* Be optimistic rather than audacious. 
    * The best possible version of possible. 
    * Write what we can accomplish if we execute on time.
* Stay concrete and specific. 
    * The more specific, the more useful visions are. 
    * Generic statements are easy to agree with bu don’t reconcile strategy.
* Keep it one or two pages long. 
    * People don’t read long documents. 
    * Leaders will skim 5-6 pages and miss details.

Good vision is usually so obvious that it bores more than it excites. Measure success by monitoring progress in design documents.

Strategies are tools of proactive alignment that allow teams to move quickly and with confidence. Enable people to make quick & confident decisions.

When the future’s too hazy to identify investments worth making, it’s time to write a vision document.
